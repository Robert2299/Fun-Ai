# üèéÔ∏è Fun Ai
Fun Ai is a captivating exploration into the enigmatic realm of neural networks, fueled by my unyielding passion for programming.

## üß† Mysterious Neural Network
Prepare to be mesmerized by the intricate workings of a fully connected multi-layer neural network. Each layer's neurons are mysteriously entwined with those of the next layer, guided by the enigmatic TanH activation function. This extraordinary network dynamically adapts its hidden layer count and neuron quantities. And let's not forget the enigmatic Bias neuron, subtly influencing the input layer. Its inner machinations are powered by my own arcane matrix math.
### üß¨ Mystical Genetic Algorithm
Marvel at the mystical genetic algorithm, for it holds the secrets to evolutionary progress. With each cycle's end, it selects the most formidable neural network, conjuring mutated replicas to replenish the population. In this ethereal domain, no mating rituals occur between network pairs. Guided by its arcane logic, the algorithm may occasionally introduce or remove a neuron or even an entire layer. Added layers always form the final connection to the output, mirroring its size.
